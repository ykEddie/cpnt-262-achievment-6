I had a few problems when I was trying to setup the props for the header component and I think I was just getting the syntax wrong. I watched the recording and it ended up working after a few changes.


One issue I had is that I tried installing tailwind multiple ways yet none of them were working. So when I was styling my footer it wouldn't go to the bottom like I wanted it to.


I think I've just been a little overwhelmed with vue so I did not get some parts of the assignment to work but I went through the vue documentation and readings so I understand what they do.
